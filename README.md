# <b><u> ðŸ›’ SaaS Sales Analysis </b></u>

This is a capstone project dedicated for Purwadhika Data Science online class on the topic of SaaS Sales Analysis. The original data can be obtained from [Amazon AWS SaaS Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nnthanh101/aws-saas-sales).
<br><br>
In this project, we are acting to serve analysis for the private SaaS company who runs operation by selling SaaS product to other companies (B2B). Our analysis will be the baseline to improve next year's strategy, which is our problem statement.

In short, our analysis consisted of multiple steps as follows:
1. Understand problem statement
2. Data understanding
3. Data cleaning
4. Analysis 1: Correlation of Geographical Location and Profit Category
5. Analysis 2: Correlation of Industry & Segment
6. Analysis 3: Top Software Product
7. Analysis 4: Correlation of Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit
8. Analysis 5: Sales & Profit Performance by Time
9. Conclusion & Recommendation


From this sequence, we can get recommended actions based on the actual sales data to drive the company's performance to be better.
